In this project, we apply image segmentation tech-niques to bird sound spectrograms. A spectrogram is es-sentially a visual snapshot of sound over time—it mapsfrequencies against time to form a rich 2D representation.Bird calls tend to form distinct patterns in these spectro-grams, which allows us to treat the problem like an imagesegmentation task.
